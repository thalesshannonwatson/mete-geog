Geographic Predictions from the Maximum Entropy Theory of Ecology
=================================================================

Research on making geographic predictions for macroecological patterns using the
Maximum Entropy Theory of Ecology (METE). We are using phenomenological and
process based models to make predictions for species richness, total community
abundance, and (potentially) total metabolic rate for six major macroecological
datasets. We are then using these predictions as the inputs for METE to make
predictions for macroecological patterns.

This work is still preliminary in nature.
